# Tropospheric Ozone Rapid Assessment Model (TORAM) repository

The **TORAM_HTAP_O3_model** github repository contains the code needed to setup and run the Tropospheric Ozone Rapid Assessment Model (TORAM). If you wish to use TORAM
then there is an BSD3 licence associated with it and can be found in the **LICENCE** file on the main repository trunk. The code is based on the initial work by Oliver Wild 
at Lancaster University undertaken as part of the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants (HTAP) project, with details found in the following publication 
[ACP paper](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/2037/2012/acp-12-2037-2012.html). The initial code was converted into the Python language and then updated as part 
of phase 2 of the HTAP project by Steven Turnock at the Met Office Hadley Centre, with details in the following [publication](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/8953/2018/). 
There have been further uses of this rapid assessment model since the last documentation paper which can be found in the wider literature 
(possibly previously referenced as the HTAP O3 model). 

The file **readme_file_for_repos.txt** outlines the files within this repository and how they should be used. Please note there are additional input files (netcdf and
.sav files) associated with the use of TORAM which are currently not included on this repository. In the future it is anticipated that these will be made available 
on an open access database for use alongside this code repository but at present if you are interested in using this code and having access to these additional files
then please contact Steven Turnock at steven.turnock@metoffice.gov.uk to discuss potential options.
